# Two-way ANOVA

## Two-way ANOVA

**What is ANOVA?**

-   **AN**alysis **O**f **VA**riance
-   Compare the means of three or more treatment groups
    -   Extension of the t-test

**When to use two-way ANOVA?**

-   Analyze the effect of two independent variables on a single response
    -   Effect of fertilizer type and planting density when measuring crop yield
    -   Effect of sugar and flour when measuring cake consistency

## Model

Let A and B represent two factors. A has levels $i=1\dots a$ and B has levels $j=1\dots b$, and there are $k=1\dots r$ replications. The model is given by:

$$
Y_{ijk}=\mu + A_i+B_j+(AB)_{ij}+\epsilon_{ijk}
$$

Where

-   $Y_{ijk}$ is the response for the $k$th replication of level $i$ for factor A and level $j$ for factor B.
-   $\mu$ is the overall mean
-   $A_i$ is the effect of level $i$ for factor A
-   $B_j$ is the effect of level $j$ for factor B
-   $(AB)_{ij}$ is the interaction effect
-   $\epsilon_{ijk}\sim iid \quad Normal(0, \sigma^2)$

Assumptions

-   Residuals are normally distributed
-   Homogeneity of variance (variance is constant)
-   Independence of observations

## ANOVA Table

| Source | Sum of Squares | df | Mean Square | F-Statistic |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Factor A | $rb\sum_{i=1}^a(\bar{Y}_{i\cdot\cdot}-\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot\cdot})^2$ | $a-1$ | $MS_A=\frac{SS_A}{(a-1)}$ | $\frac{MS_A}{MS_E}$ |
| Factor B | $ra\sum_{j=1}^b(\bar{Y}_{\cdot j\cdot}-\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot\cdot})^2$ | $b-1$ | $MS_B=\frac{SS_B}{(b-1)}$ | $\frac{MS_B}{MS_E}$ |
| Interaction (A x B) | $r\sum_{i=1}^a\sum_{j=1}^b(\bar{Y}_{ij\cdot}-\bar{Y}_{i\cdot\cdot}-\bar{Y}_{\cdot j\cdot}+\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot\cdot})^2$ | $(a-1)(b-1)$ | $MS_{AB}=\frac{SS_{AB}}{(a-1)(b-1)}$ | $\frac{MS_{AB}}{MS_E}$ |
| Error | $\sum_{i=1}^a\sum_{j=1}^b\sum_{k=1}^r(Y_{ijk}-\bar{Y}_{ij\cdot})^2$ | $ab(r-1)$ | $MS_E=\frac{SS_E}{ab(r-1)}$ |  |
| Total | $\sum_{i=1}^a\sum_{j=1}^b\sum_{k=1}^r(Y_{ijk}-\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot\cdot})^2$ | $abr-1$ |  |  |

: ANOVA Table

p-values are calculated by taking the probability of observing the F-statistic or larger values from an F-distribution.

# Example 1: Fertilizer Experiment

## Example 1

An experiment was conducted to measure the effect of fertilizer on the growth height of a plant. Researchers used two brands of fertilizers (Easy-Plant and Fast-Grow) with two quantities (low and high). Each combination of fertilizer brand and quantity were applied to individual pots of plants, measuring the plant height after a set growing period.

Link to datasets: [https://github.com/StatHelpUNL/Workshop_25Spring](https://github.com/StatHelpUNL/Workshop_25Spring)

You can load the data using the following code:

```{r}
#| echo: true
agriculture <- read.csv('data/example1-agriculture.csv')
head(agriculture)
```

## Interaction plots

```{r}
#| echo: true

with(agriculture, interaction.plot(brand, fertilizer, height))
with(agriculture, interaction.plot(fertilizer, brand, height))
```

## Fitting a model

```{r}
#| echo: true


model1 <- lm(height ~ fertilizer*brand,
             data = agriculture)
model1

# aov(height ~ fertilizer*brand,
#              data = agriculture)
```

## Model Summary

```{r}
#| echo: true


summary(model1)
```

## ANOVA Table

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

anova(model1)

library(car)
Anova(model1, type = 3)
```

## Estimated Means

The interaction term was significant, so we should only consider differences at each treatment combination.

```{r}
#| echo: true


library(emmeans)
em1 <- emmeans(model1, ~brand*fertilizer)
em1

emmeans(model1, ~fertilizer|brand)
```

## Estimated differences

```{r}
#| echo: true

pairs(em1)
pairs(em1, infer = c(T,T))
```

## Fit of model

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| layout-nrow: 2
#| echo: true

plot(model1)
```

# Example 2: Bacteria Growth

## Example 2

An experiment was conducted to measure the effect of pH and salt concentration on bacteria growth.
Bacteria were placed into Petri dishes and were given a solution that consisted of a pH and salt concentration combination.
pH levels were set at levels of 6, 7, and 8, and salt concentration levels were set at 15%, 20%, and 25%.
After a set amount of time, the bacteria growth was measured by log CFU (colony forming unit).

```{r}
bacteria <- read.csv('data/example2-bacteria.csv')
head(bacteria)
```

## Interaction plots

```{r}
#| echo: true
with(bacteria, interaction.plot(ph, salt, logcfu))
with(bacteria, interaction.plot(salt, ph, logcfu))
```

## Fitting a model

**Option 1:** categorical factors

- Use this option if you are interested in the categories themselves.
- Same approach as previous example, but convert treatments to factors.

```{r}
#| echo: true
model2a <- lm(logcfu ~ factor(ph)*factor(salt), 
              data = bacteria)
```

**Option 2:** quantitative factors

- Use this option if you are interested in measuring polynomial trends and/or making predictions.

```{r}
#| echo: true
model2b <- lm(logcfu ~ (ph + I(ph^2))*(salt + I(salt^2)),
              data = bacteria)
```

Note: You can get the same results from both models using polynomial orthogonal contrasts.

## Model Summary

```{r}
summary(model2b)
```

## ANOVA Table

```{r}
anova(model2b)
```

## Estimated Means

```{r}
em2 <- emmeans(model2b, ~ph*salt)
em2
```

What happened here??

## Estimated Means

```{r}
em2b <- emmeans(model2b, ~ph*salt,
                at = list(ph = c(6, 7, 8),
                          salt = c(15, 20, 25)))
em2b
```

## Differences

```{r}
pairs(em2b)
```

## Fit of Model

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| layout-nrow: 2


plot(model2b)
```



# Wrap-up

## Other Considerations

- R uses Type I Sums of Squares by default.
    - Type I: sequential fit, good for regression
    - Type III: fits all together, good for categorical treatment factors
    - For balanced design, these will give same result

```{r}
#| eval: false
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))
```

- Model matrices are defined differently compared to other software packages.
    - Model coefficients could be different, but results are the same
    - See `?contr.sum` for more details
